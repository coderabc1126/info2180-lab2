    <p class="default"> Growing up, I always loved the water and swimming. I did swimming at both my prep and high school and I was even on my high school's swim team. I was apart of the swim club and did swimming every friday. I also attended swim meets to represent my school.
  </p>
  <p class="default"> Although I was in water and swimming. I didn't like competing. I realize that I didn't want to racing aganist others and would rather persons just haave fun and play in the water. This is why I became a lifeguard. I ensure that persons are safe while they have fun.

    <p class="default"> I have always had a love for foreign languages. I did Spanish and French doing my high school year and I always excelled at it. I was even the President of the Modern Languages Club at my school.</p>
  <p class="default">I decided to learn over one Summer and I was even more excited to learn that UWI offered Chinese. I am currently doing 3rd year Chinese courses. I hope to learn more languages in the future.
